# Evo MCP docs

Design documentation for the `evo-mcp` server.

## Scope

These docs cover the **estimation workflow** additions introduced in the `kriging-workflows` branch:
the session/staging infrastructure, and MCP tool groups for staging and compute.

**Not yet covered here:** data ingestion tools (`build_and_create_*`), workspace/file management tools, user administration tools, the broader MCP server setup and configuration.
