# Session layer — `evo_mcp/session/`

Maps **human-readable names** to internal staged objects.
Tools register objects by name after creation; downstream tools look them up by name.

## Structure

```
session/
  models.py    RegistryEntry  (name, type, stage_id, status, summary)
  resolver.py  ObjectResolver (case-insensitive matching) + DuplicateNameError
  registry.py  ObjectRegistry (module-level singleton)
```

---

## Name resolution

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["resolve(name, object_type?)"] --> B{Exact match?}
    B -- yes --> DONE[return entry]
    B -- no --> C{Case-insensitive match?}
    C -- unambiguous --> DONE
    C -- multiple types --> ERR["ResolutionError: specify type"]
    C -- not found --> ERR2["ResolutionError: lists available names"]
    A2["resolve(type only)"] --> LATEST["return most recently created of that type"]
```

---

## Key API

```python
# After staging — raises DuplicateNameError if the name+type already exists
object_registry.register(name="CU variogram", object_type="variogram", stage_id=...)

# In a downstream tool
entry, payload = object_registry.get_payload("CU variogram")

# After publishing to Evo
object_registry.mark_published(name="CU variogram", object_type="variogram", object_id="<evo-uuid>")
```

`object_registry` is a **module-level singleton** shared across all tool modules.

---

## Duplicate name handling

`register()` rejects any name+type combination already present in the session.
This applies to every creation path — local build, import, and dev fixture seeding.

```python
# Second import of the same object name raises immediately:
# DuplicateNameError: An object named 'CU variogram' of type 'variogram' is already staged.
#   Discard it first with staging_discard_object before registering a new one.
```

The caller must explicitly discard the existing object before registering a replacement.
`DuplicateNameError` is a `ValueError` subclass and surfaces directly as a tool error.
